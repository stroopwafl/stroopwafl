We live in the age of magic \
That has long been foretold \
My brother, we are talking to sand! \
Magic rocks whir to the beat of Jensen \
A whip-crack-bang-Huang \
Abra-kadabra goes FAANG \
Wingardium leviosa, dumbledore lore no more \
“Altman after vindaloo and korma; hyperreal, dynamic, warmer”
I recite the devil’s spell to a transformer
